Grow With Google Basic Final Project

This web application uses jQuery to create an interactive pixel canvas. You can set the size of the canvas in pixels and color them however you see fit.
Pixel art maker is the final project in Udacity and Google's basic front-end web developer course. I would like to thank Google and Udacity for selecting me for this scholarship and learning opportunity.
